/**
 * @page specifications Notes on SDI-12, Specification v1.4
 *
 * @tableofcontents
 *
 * @section overview Overview
 *
 * SDI-12 is a communications protocol that uses a single data wire to communicate with
 * up to 62 uniquely addressed sensors.  So long as each sensor supports SDI-12, mixed
 * sensor types can appear on the same data bus.  Each address is a single character.
 * The valid ranges are 0-9, a-z, and A-Z. Only the datalogger can initiate
 * communications on the data bus.
 *
 * It does so by pulling the data line into a 5v state for at least 12 milliseconds to
 * wake up all the sensors, before returning the line into a 0v state for 8 milliseconds
 * announce an outgoing command.  The command contains both the action to be taken, and
 * the address of the device who should respond.  If there is a sensor on the bus with
 * that address, it is responsible for responding to the command.  Sensors should ignore
 * commands that were not issued to them, and should return to a sleep state until the
 * datalogger again issues the wakeup sequence.
 *
 * @section connection_details Connection Details
 *
 * **Physical Connections:**
 *   - 1 data line (0v - 5.5v)
 *   - 1 12v power line (9.6v - 16v)
 *   - 1 ground line
 *
 * **Baud Rate:**
 *   - 1200 bits per second
 *
 * **Data Frame Format:**
 *   - 10 bits per data frame
 *   - 1 start bit
 *   - 7 data bits (least significant bit first)
 *   - 1 even parity bit
 *   - 1 stop bit
 *
 * Data Line:  SDI-12 communication uses a single bi-directional data line with
 * three-state, inverse logic.
 *
 * | LINE CONDITION | BINARY STATE | VOLTAGE RANGE     |
 * |----------------|--------------|-------------------|
 * | marking        |      1       | -0.5 to 1.0 volts |
 * | spacing        |      0       | 3.5 to 5.5 volts  |
 * | transition     |  undefined   | 1.0 to 3.5 volts  |
 *
 * While a series of bits is being transmitted on the dataline, the voltage level on
 * that line might look something like this:
 *
 * @code
 *       _____       _____       _____       _____       _____     spacing
 * 5v   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
 *      |  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  0  | transition
 * Ov___|     |_____|     |_____|     |_____|     |_____|     |___ marking
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note Although the specification gives these voltages, some manufacturers chose to
 * implement SDI-12 at other logic levels - ie, with spacing voltages lower or higher
 * than the specified ~5V.
 *
 * For more information, and for a list of commands and responses, please see
 * SDI-12.org, official site of the SDI-12 Support Group.

   * The '%' or modulo operator finds the remainder of division of one number by

   * Because we are using pin change interrupts there can only be one active object at a
   * time (since this is the only reliable way to determine which pin the interrupt
   * occurred on).  The active object is the only object that will respond properly to
   * interrupts.  However promoting another instance to Active status does not
   * automatically remove the interrupts on the other pin. For proper behavior it is
   * recommended to use this pattern:
   *
   * @code{.cpp}
   *     mySDI12.forceHold();
   *     myOtherSDI12.setActive();
   * @endcode
   *
   * @note
   * - Promoting an object into the Active state will set it as `SDI12_HOLDING`.
   * - Calling mySDI12.begin() will assert mySDI12 as the new active object, until
   * another instance calls myOtherSDI12.begin() or myOtherSDI12.setActive().
   * - Calling mySDI12.end() does NOT hand-off active status to another SDI-12 instance.
   * - You can check on the active object by calling mySDI12.isActive(), which will
   * return a boolean value TRUE if active or FALSE if inactive.

   * @anchor line_states
   * @name Data Line States
   *
   * @brief Functions for maintaining the proper data line state.
   *
   * The Arduino is responsible for managing communication with the sensors.  Since all
   * the data transfer happens on the same line, the state of the data line is very
   * important.
   *
   * @section line_state_spec Specifications
   *
   * Per the SDI-12 specification, the voltage ranges for SDI-12 are:
   *
   * - When the pin is in the SDI12_HOLDING state, it is holding the line LOW so that
   * interference does not unintentionally wake the sensors up.  The interrupt is
   * disabled for the dataPin, because we are not expecting any SDI-12 traffic.
   * - In the SDI12_TRANSMITTING state, we would like exclusive control of the Arduino,
   * so we shut off all interrupts, and vary the voltage of the dataPin in order to wake
   * up and send commands to the sensor.
   * - In the SDI12_LISTENING state, we are waiting for a sensor to respond, so we drop
   * the voltage level to LOW and relinquish control (INPUT).
   * - If we would like to disable all SDI-12 functionality, then we set the system to
   * the SDI12_DISABLED state, removing the interrupt associated with the dataPin.  For
   * predictability, we set the pin to a LOW level high impedance state (INPUT).
   *
   * @section line_state_table As a Table
   *
   * Summarized in a table:
   *
   * | State               | Interrupts       | Pin Mode   | Pin Level |
   * |---------------------|------------------|------------|-----------|
   * | SDI12_DISABLED      | Pin Disable      | INPUT      | ---       |
   * | SDI12_ENABLED       | Pin Disable      | INPUT      | ---       |
   * | SDI12_HOLDING       | Pin Disable      | OUTPUT     | LOW       |
   * | SDI12_TRANSMITTING  | All/Pin Disable  | OUTPUT     | VARYING   |
   * | SDI12_LISTENING     | All Enable       | INPUT      | ---       |
   *
   *
   * @section line_state_seq Sequencing
   *
   * Generally, this flow of line states is acceptable:
   *
   * `HOLDING --> TRANSMITTING --> LISTENING --> TRANSMITTING --> LISTENING`
   *
   * If you have interference, you should force a hold, using forceHold().
   * The flow would then be:
   *
   * `HOLDING --> TRANSMITTING --> LISTENING -->` done reading, forceHold() `--->
   * HOLDING`
