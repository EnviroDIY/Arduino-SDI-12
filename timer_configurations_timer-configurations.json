The speed of the timer is dependent on the speed of the processor and &quot;dividers&quot; and &quot;prescalers&quot; used to slow the effective clock. Unfortunately, the &quot;ticks&quot; of the processor clock aren&#x27;t perfectly aligned with the times of the level changes from the SDI-12 device. With the clocks not perfectly aligned, we can&#x27;t know exactly the time that a bit started or ended, just the time of the last readable tick. This means we need to do some averaging and &quot;fudging&quot; to align the two.</p><aside class=\"m-note m-default\"><h4>See also</h4><p>rx_page for more information on how a character is created.</p></aside><section id=\"timer_configurations_sdi-12-timing-rules\"><h2>SDI-12 Timing Rules</h2><p>SDI-12 Communicates at 1200 baud (bits/s) and sends each character using 10 bits (7E1).</p><ul><li>Character Times:<ul><li>1 bit = 0.83333 ms (?? tolerance ??)</li><li>1 character = 8.33333 ms</li><li>maximum marking between character stop (LOW) and next character start (HIGH) = 1.66ms (<strong>no tolerance</strong>)<ul><li>This is equivalent to 2 bits!</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Break and Marking Times<ul><li>maximum sensor wake time (between a break and start bit) = 100ms \u00b1 0.4ms</li><li>minimum marking (LOW) return-to-sleep time = 100ms \u00b1 0.4ms</li><li>recorder break (HIGH) between commands = &gt;12ms \u00b1 0.4ms (ie, &gt;12.5ms)</li><li>maximum recorder marking (LOW) before a start bit (HIGH) = &gt;8.33ms \u00b1 0.4ms (ie, &gt;8.73ms)</li><li>maximum time before relinquishing line control after stop bit = 7.5ms \u00b1 0.4ms</li><li>maximum marking (LOW) before a new waking break (HIGH) must be issued = 87ms \u00b1 0.4ms<ul><li>A break is also required when switching between sensors</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Retry Times<ul><li>There are two retry &quot;loops&quot; - an &quot;inner&quot; loop of retries without breaks between and an &quot;outer&quot; loop of retries with breaks in between</li><li>Inner Retries (<em>without</em> breaks between)<ul><li>Response window before a retry = 16.67ms - 87ms (&lt; 87ms = time before a break is required)</li><li>A minimum of 3 &quot;inner&quot; retries are required.</li><li>At least one of the &quot;inner&quot; retries must start &gt;100ms after the falling edge (end) of the break that started the innter retry loop.</li></ul></li><li>Outer Retries (<em>with</em> breaks between)<ul><li>Outer retries are used after &gt;112.5ms of inner retries have been attempted</li><li>A minimum of 3 &quot;outer&quot; retries are required.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></section><section id=\"timer_configurations_ideal-timer-settings\"><h2>Ideal Timer Settings</h2><p>When setting up our timers, the goal is to be able to have as many ticks as possible for each bit. The more ticks we have, the better job we can do with the needed averaging and fudging. With &lt;10 ticks/bit, we probably won&#x27;t be accurate enough to be functional. But, we also need to make sure that the clock timer doesn&#x27;t roll over before the end of the 8.33ms required for each character. When acting as a recording device, it would be even better if the timer could last until the end of a 112.5ms retry timer before rolling over. There is no benefit to the timer lasting longer than 112.5ms before rolling over.</p><p>Each timer has finite options for pre-scaling, often in powers of 2. To catch all the bits we need, when selecting the prescaler, we must round **UP** to the next closest available prescaler number (round **DOWN** the Hz) to give us *more* ticks than required.</p><p>Using a 16 bit counter, the counter rolls after 65536 ticks.</p><ul><li>Going for the maximum retry time, 112.5ms / 65536 ticks<ul><li>1.71661376953125 \u00b5sec/tick, 582.54222 kHz</li><li>485.25767 ticks/bit</li><li>This is *plenty* of ticks per bit!
