# Examples using the SDI-12 Library

- Example A: Gets sensor information from a single attached sensor and prints it to the serial port
- Example B: Allows you to change the address of your SDI-12 Sensor
- Example C: Checks all addresses for active sensors, and prints their status to the serial port
- Example D: Checks all addresses for active sensors, and logs data for each sensor every minute
- Example E: Demonstrates the ability to parse integers and floats from the buffer.
- Example F: Issues a data request to a single specified sensor
- Example G: Demonstrates using the Arduino as a command terminal for SDI-12 sensors.
- Example H: Demonstrates using SDI-12 in slave mode
- Example I: Shows code for an Arduino-based USB dongle to translate between SDI-12 and a PC
- Example J: Shows how to use an external PCInt library to call the interrupts for this library.
