# Example E: Parsing Integers and Floats from the Buffer

This example demonstrates the ability to parse integers and floats from the buffer.
It is based closely on example D, however, every other time it prints out data, it multiplies the data by a factor of 2.

```
Time Elapsed (s), Sensor Address and ID, Measurement 1, Measurement 2, ... etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6,c13SENSOR ATM    311,0.62 x 2 = 1.24,19.80 x 2 = 39.60
17,c13SENSOR ATM   311,0.62,19.7
29,c13SENSOR ATM   311,0.62 x 2 = 1.2419.70 x 2 = 39.40
41,c13SENSOR ATM   311,0.62,19.8
```

This is a trivial and nonsensical example, but it does demonstrate the ability to manipulate incoming data.
